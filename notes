If a file called twicelib.lua is present in the current
folder then all it takes to load the file while opening
the interpreter is either of these 2 things :

lua -i -ltwicelib

OR

lua -i
>dofile('twicelib.lua)

If the function being accessed is called twice, then it
can be executed in both interpreters simply by
executing:

>twice(2)
4
>
